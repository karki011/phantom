# Phantom

**A native desktop workspace for developers — terminal, editor, composer, git diff, and journal in one tabbed pane system, backed by a local AI engine with dependency graph intelligence.**

> **macOS only** (Apple Silicon + Intel). Windows and Linux are not supported today. See [Platform support](#platform-support).

## What it is

Phantom collapses your terminal, code editor, AI composer, git diff viewer, journal, and markdown preview into a single tabbed pane system — so you stop alt-tabbing between iTerm, VS Code, ChatGPT, and your git client and just work in one place. It's built on Wails (Go + SolidJS) for native performance, watches your filesystem in real time, routes every git call through a hardened wrapper to keep state sane, and ships with a first-class AI engine that's hook-aware and MCP-channel-ready — meaning the AI can see what you're editing, what changed, and what you ran, then act on it.

## Status

- **Platform:** macOS only (Apple Silicon + Intel — universal binary)
- **Version:** 0.1.9
- **Distribution:** Signed with Apple Developer ID + notarized + stapled (no Gatekeeper prompts)

## Platform support

| OS | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon + Intel) | Supported | Primary target. Universal binary, signed + notarized. |
| **Windows** | Not supported | No build target, no installer, untested. Wails *can* target Windows via WebView2 — contributors welcome. |
| **Linux** | Not supported | No build target, untested. Wails *can* target Linux via WebKitGTK — contributors welcome. |

Phantom is built for macOS first because the AI engine, file watcher, audio cues, Keychain integration, and shell integration are all tuned to macOS conventions (`~/Library/`, AVFoundation, Security framework, etc.). Cross-platform support isn't on the near-term roadmap. If you need Windows or Linux, open an issue or send a PR — but treat both as greenfield work.

## Install (prebuilt)

1. Download `Phantom-latest.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/karki011/phantom/releases)
2. Unzip and drag `Phantom.app` to `/Applications`
3. Double-click — no first-launch internet required (notarization is stapled)

## Build from source

> Build instructions assume macOS. Windows/Linux builds are not supported.

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode Command Line Tools
- [Go](https://go.dev/) 1.25+
- [Wails CLI](https://wails.io/) — `go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest`
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 10+

### Development

```bash
cd v2
wails dev      # or: make dev
```

### Release (signed + notarized + zipped)

```bash
cd v2
make release-zip   # signed + notarized zip
make release       # signed + notarized DMG (requires `brew install create-dmg`)
```

Apple notarization credentials are loaded from `phantom-os/.env.notarize` (gitignored — see `.env.notarize.example`).

### Authentication

Phantom supports two authentication modes. All local features (AI engine, graph, hooks, MCP, safety) work with both.

| Mode | Setup | Billing |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Subscription** (Max/Pro/Enterprise) | `claude login` — zero config | Included in subscription |
| **BYOK API Key** | Settings > AI Provider > enter key | Per-token via Anthropic API |

BYOK keys are stored in the macOS Keychain and never logged to disk.

- **Auto-accept toggle** — persisted preference, auto-marks edit cards as accepted
- **ASSISTANT/YOU badges** with turn dividers between conversation turns
- **Edit card review** — accept/discard per-file with inline diff viewer
- **Model picker** — Sonnet 4.6 / Opus / Haiku
- **Effort level control** — Auto / Low / Medium / High / Max

- **Drag and drop file mentions** + image paste
- **No-context mode toggle**
- **Session persistence** across app restarts

### AI Engine

Local Go-based reasoning engine with dependency graph intelligence. Runs entirely on-device — no cloud calls for engine logic.

- **7+ reasoning strategies:** Direct, Decompose, Advisor, SelfRefine, TreeOfThought, Debate, GraphOfThought
- **Orchestrator pipeline:** assess > graph context > blast radius > select strategy > decide > verify > learn
- **Dependency graph intelligence** — file-level graph with blast radius analysis, related file discovery, shortest path queries
- **Auto-tune** — EMA-smoothed threshold recalibration based on observed outcomes
- **Decision learning** — per-project SQLite storage, cross-project `GlobalPatternStore`
- **Hallucination detection** — verifies file paths referenced in AI responses actually exist on disk
- **Gap detector** — identifies missing context before the AI acts
- **Penalty system** — tracks repeated failures to avoid known-bad approaches
- **Context injector** — enriches prompts with graph context automatically
- **Multi-language support** — parsers for TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java

### Safety and Security

- **Ward rules engine** — YAML-based guardrails in `~/.phantom-os/wards/` (block patterns, require patterns, file scope filters)
- **PII scanner** — detects emails, API keys, AWS keys, passwords, tokens before they leave the machine
- **Edit gate hook** — blocks Write/Edit/MultiEdit tool calls when enabled via preferences
- **Audit logging** — `ward_audit` SQLite table for all rule evaluations
- **BYOK key storage** — macOS Keychain via Security framework (never written to disk or logs)

### Desktop Workspace

- **Terminal** — full PTY via xterm.js 6.0 with 497 themes, OSC 633 shell integration, Quick-Fix on errors, sticky scroll, jump-to-prompt, Cmd+P command history palette, persistent sessions (hot + cold restore), addon-serialize PTY snapshots, tab auto-rename via OSC 0/1/2
- **Editor** — Monaco-based code editor with diff support, workspace tsconfig + @types loaded for real type checking
- **Diff** — live git diff viewer with folding, inline editing, and save
- **Composer** — agentic coding pane (see above)
- **Journal** — per-project journaling with date pagination, AI-generated daily digest
- **Home** — workspace dashboard with project cards, graph stats, quick launch grid, git status, PR/CI badges
- **File browser** — tree view with search, drag-to-mention, create file/folder, context menus
- **Git workflow** — branch switcher, push/pull with feedback, discard, stash, undo commit, PR creation, worktree management

### Hook System and MCP

- **6 auto-registered hooks:** prompt-enricher, edit-gate, outcome-capture, feedback-detector, async-analyzer, file-changed
- **MCP server (`phantom-ai`)** with 10+ tools:
  - `phantom_before_edit` — pre-edit context + blast radius + strategy (one call does it all)
  - `phantom_graph_context` — file dependency deep-dive
  - `phantom_graph_blast_radius` — what breaks if a file changes
  - `phantom_graph_related` — find all files involved in a feature

  - `phantom_graph_path` — shortest dependency path between two files
  - `phantom_orchestrator_process` — route goals through the strategy pipeline
  - `phantom_orchestrator_history` — learn from past decisions
  - `phantom_evaluate_output` — verify AI output quality
  - `phantom_list_projects` — enumerate tracked projects
- **Auto-registration** in `~/.mcp.json` and `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **Hook events visible** in Composer via `--include-hook-events`

### Gamification

- **XP system** with 6 stat categories: Intelligence, Strength, Sense, Vitality, Agility, Perception
- **Achievements** and **daily quests**
- **Streaks** — consecutive day tracking
- **Rank progression** with level thresholds
- **Hunter profile** — stats dashboard on the home screen

### Multi-Provider Support

Config-driven provider architecture supporting multiple AI CLIs.

| Provider | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | Full support | Primary target — sessions, streaming, conversation parsing, cost tracking |
| **OpenAI Codex** | Supported | SQLite + JSONL session discovery, event schema parsing |
| **Gemini** | Config-ready | YAML config; adapter pending |

Provider configs are 3-tier: embedded defaults > user overrides (`~/.phantom-os/providers/`) > custom providers (`~/.phantom-os/providers/custom/`).

## For agents

If you are an LLM/coding agent loading this repo, start with **`v2/llms-full.txt`** at the repo root. It is a single-file digest of the curated docs (README, AI engine, config-driven architecture, plans) and is sized to fit in a single context window.

Regenerate it after doc changes:

```bash
cd v2 && make docs-llm
```

## Contributing

This is an early-stage project. Issues and PRs welcome — but expect things to move fast and break.

### Commit messages (semver + changelog)

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) drive **release-please** updates to `CHANGELOG.md` and version bumps:

| Bump   | When to use | Example subject |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **patch** | fixes | `fix(v2): close server log drawer on escape` |
| **minor** | new behavior, backward compatible | `feat(v2): export server log to file` |
| **major** | breaking API / behavior | `feat(v2)!: rename GetRecentAppLogs` or a body line `BREAKING CHANGE: …` |

Use **`feat`**, **`fix`**, **`perf`**, **`docs`**, etc., with an optional scope like **`(v2)`**. Squash-merge PRs with **one** conventional title so `main` history stays clean for the bot.
